You're right, let's break down the to-do list, prioritize it, and add any missing items to get the main functionality implemented.

**Prioritized To-Do List:**

Here's a prioritized list, focusing on the essential elements for a functional integration:

**High Priority (Must-Have for Basic Functionality):**

1. **Implement Tool Calling (Python Tools):**
    *   **Details:** This is crucial for agent interaction. We need to finalize the mechanism for:
        *   Sending tool call requests from Elixir to Python (including tool name and arguments).
        *   Executing the corresponding Python tool function in `agent_wrapper.py`.
        *   Returning the tool result back to Elixir.
    *   **Files Involved:**
        *   `axon_core/lib/axon_core/agent_process.ex` (sending requests, receiving responses)
        *   `axon_python/src/axon_python/agent_wrapper.py` (handling tool calls, invoking `pydantic-ai` tools)
    *   **Considerations:**
        *   Decide on the format for sending tool arguments (currently, it seems we are using JSON).
        *   Handle potential errors during tool execution.
    *   **Implementation Notes:**
        *   **`agent_wrapper.py`:**
            ```python
            @app.post("/agents/{agent_id}/tool_call")
            async def call_tool(agent_id: str, tool_name: str, request_data: dict):
                # 1. Get the agent instance based on agent_id.
                # 2. Find the corresponding tool function based on tool_name.
                # 3. Extract and validate arguments from request_data.
                # 4. Call the tool function.
                # 5. Return the result.
            ```
        *   **`agent_process.ex`:**
            ```elixir
            # In handle_call for :send_message or a dedicated handler for tool calls:
            # ...
            case HTTPClient.post(tool_call_endpoint, headers, JSONCodec.encode(tool_call_data)) do
              {:ok, response} ->
                # Process tool result
              {:error, reason} ->
                # Handle error
            end
            # ...
            ```

2. **Refine Schema Translation (Basic Types):**
    *   **Details:** We need to handle basic data types for tool parameters and result types. This is essential for data exchange between Elixir and Python.
    *   **Files Involved:**
        *   `axon_core/lib/axon_core/schema_utils.ex`
    *   **Considerations:**
        *   Start with support for `string`, `integer`, `boolean`, `number`, `null`, `list`, and `map` (for nested objects).
        *   Ensure that `elixir_to_json_schema` and `json_schema_to_elixir_type` are consistent.
    *   **Implementation Notes:**
        *   Extend the existing functions in `schema_utils.ex` to handle lists and nested maps recursively.

3. **Implement Result Validation (Basic):**
    *   **Details:** Implement basic validation of the agent's result against the `result_type` schema. We can start with simple type checking and structure validation in Elixir.
    *   **Files Involved:**
        *   `axon_core/lib/axon_core/agent_process.ex` (when handling the final result)
        *   `axon_core/lib/axon_core/schema_utils.ex` (if using `jason_schema` for validation)
    *   **Considerations:**
        *   Decide where validation should primarily happen (Elixir or Python).
        *   Handle validation errors appropriately (retry, log, or raise exceptions).
    *   **Implementation Notes:**
        *   You might use `Jason.Schema.validate` in `handle_call` after receiving the result from Python.
        *   Consider adding a configuration option to enable/disable result validation.

4. **Complete `handle_info` for Non-Streaming Responses:**
    *   **Details:** We need to fully implement the logic for receiving and processing non-streaming responses from the Python agent. This includes handling success cases, errors, and log messages.
    *   **Files Involved:**
        *   `axon_core/lib/axon_core/agent_process.ex`
    *   **Implementation Notes:**
        *   Add proper pattern matching on the `response` to handle different `status_code` values.
        *   Use `Logger` to log messages received from the Python agent.

**Medium Priority (Important for Usability and Robustness):**

5. **Streaming Implementation (Basic Text Streaming):**
    *   **Details:** Implement basic text streaming from the Python agent to the Elixir client.
    *   **Files Involved:**
        *   `axon_python/src/axon_python/agent_wrapper.py` (using `StreamingResponse` in FastAPI)
        *   `axon_core/lib/axon_core/agent_process.ex` (`handle_info` for `:poll_stream` and potentially `:stream_chunk`)
    *   **Considerations:**
        *   Decide on a polling interval or use a more advanced mechanism like WebSockets if necessary.
        *   Handle chunking and buffering of streamed data.
    *   **Implementation Notes:**
        *   In `agent_wrapper.py`, use `StreamingResponse` to send chunks.
        *   In `AgentProcess`, either use `async_stream` or implement a polling loop to receive chunks.

6. **Error Handling (Robust):**
    *   **Details:** Implement comprehensive error handling to catch all relevant exceptions in `agent_wrapper.py` and translate them into structured error responses. Define how different error types (validation errors, model errors, tool errors) are handled and reported to Elixir.
    *   **Files Involved:**
        *   `axon_python/src/axon_python/agent_wrapper.py`
        *   `axon_core/lib/axon_core/agent_process.ex`
    *   **Implementation Notes:**
        *   Use `try...except` blocks in `agent_wrapper.py` to catch exceptions.
        *   Define a consistent format for error responses (e.g., JSON with `status`, `error_type`, `message`, and optional `details`).
        *   In `AgentProcess`, pattern match on error types and handle them appropriately (retry, restart, log, etc.).

7. **Logging:**
    *   **Details:** Implement more detailed logging, especially within `AxonCore.AgentProcess` to track the flow of messages, agent state, and any errors encountered.
    *   **Files Involved:**
        *   `axon_core/lib/axon_core/agent_process.ex`
        *   `axon_python/src/axon_python/agent_wrapper.py`
    *   **Implementation Notes:**
        *   Use Elixir's `Logger` with appropriate log levels (debug, info, warning, error).
        *   Consider using structured logging (e.g., log as JSON) for easier parsing and analysis.
        *   Log important events like agent creation, message sending/receiving, tool calls, errors, and retries.

**Low Priority (Advanced Features and Optimizations):**

8. **Asynchronous Agent Management:**
    *   **Details:** Explore using `Task` supervision or other asynchronous mechanisms to improve the management of Python agent processes.
9. **gRPC Integration:**
    *   **Details:** Implement gRPC as an alternative communication protocol if performance becomes a bottleneck.
10. **Enhanced Schema Translation:**
    *   **Details:** Build a more sophisticated schema translation mechanism to handle complex Pydantic models, including custom validators and constraints.
11. **Dynamic Tool Calling (Elixir):**
    *   **Details:** Implement a more robust mechanism for calling Elixir functions dynamically from `ToolUtils`.
12. **Security:**
    *   **Details:** Add authentication and authorization to the HTTP API exposed by `agent_wrapper.py`.
13. **Monitoring and Metrics:**
    *   **Details:** Integrate with monitoring tools like Prometheus or StatsD to track agent performance and resource usage.
14. **Python Stub Generation:**
    *   **Details:** Investigate automatically generating Python stub code from Elixir tool definitions.

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Testing:** Write unit tests for all modules and integration tests to verify the interaction between Elixir and Python.
*   **Documentation:**  Update the README and add detailed documentation for all modules and functions.

**Focusing on the Initial Implementation:**

For now, we should concentrate on items 1-4 from the "High Priority" list. These are essential for a basic, functional integration. Once these are working, we can move on to streaming, more robust error handling, and then the lower-priority items.

By prioritizing these tasks and taking an iterative approach, we can build a solid foundation for Axon and gradually enhance its capabilities. I'll be here to assist you as we implement each of these features. Let's get started with the `Tool Calling (Python Tools)` since you have done preliminary work on `schema_utils.ex`.
